This is the final project for the stat 311 course at Metro State University for the Fall 2025 semester. In this project we will use linear regression to make a predictive model for the amount of gold a team has at 20 minutes as it relates to cs, kills, xp, and gold at 10 minutes as well as multiple per minute metrics.
