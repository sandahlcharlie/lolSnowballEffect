This is the final project for the stat 311 course at Metro State University for the Fall 2025 semester. In this project we will use linear regression to make a predictive model for the amount of gold a team has at 20 minutes as it relates to cs, kills, xp, and gold at 10 minutes as well as multiple per minute metrics.

Most Recent Filtered Dataset:
(data/filteredData.csv)

The data is from (https://oracleselixir.com/tools/downloads) and hosted on (https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1gLSw0RLjBbtaNy0dgnGQDAZOHIgCe-HH). We are using the data from 2025.
The script to filter it as well as the most recent output is in (data/). 
The script will ask for the input folder as well as an output folder. 
!MAKE SURE OUTPUT FOLDER IS DIFFERENT THAN INPUT FOLDER!
If not it will keep adding the output.csv to the next one, increasing the rows and messing with the data. I will have to fix this in the future.
